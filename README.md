## ChainED

* Enables content creator to influence learners behaviour
* Incentivizing learners and content creators
* emphasize on Information, skill, habit, motivation and environment
* UN Sustainability (quality education) and 10 (Reduce inequality)

We created a dApp that can connect learner and content creator together to achieve learning goals, that can create business impact for the organization. Content creator can signup, create courses, assign reward for courses. Learners can signup, purchase and learn the courses, take assessment and earn rewards in USDCx super token. Learners can unwrap the token to stable coin and withdraw to their exchange account.

## Problem Statement

Learner's drop out rate is up by **67 %** with most of them leaving due to a lack of Motivation and engaging content. We need to fix this problem by focusing on ways to **Motivate** the users ,Personalise and **Reward** their learning journey.

For Course Creators,
Inability to influence learners behavior and delayed payments

For Platform,
Expensive to onboard new learners and attract new Course Creators

## Mission Statement

We enable the content creators to influence the learners behavior and make them consistent and engaged. How ?
The Course creator incentivizes the learners by offering a reward when they achieve a milestone.
